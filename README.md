### Description

PodBooth is a tool for getting a first listen on your favorite podcasts and giving live feedback to make them even better! After creating an account, podcast owners can list their podcast and begin a live broadcast. During this session, their audio will be broadcast to podcast subscribers. The owner and all subscribers can comment and upvote comments, filtering by most recent or most popular. All comments and audio disappear after the broadcast, so use feedback in the moment. If you're doing an interview, see what comments spark your subscribers' interest, then drill down for more!
